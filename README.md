# PyBank

I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll

I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, the final script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
